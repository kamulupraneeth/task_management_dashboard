# Task Management Dashboard

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start mock API with `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`
4. Run the app with `npm start`

## Architecture

- React functional components with hooks
- JSON-server for mock API
- `react-beautiful-dnd` for drag and drop
- Local state management with useState/useEffect
