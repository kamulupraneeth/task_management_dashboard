## Half-Page Summary

The project is a functional kanban-style dashboard using React. It supports CRUD operations on tasks, drag-and-drop status changes, and uses a mock REST API. The UI is clean and responsive.

## Self-Criticism

- Lacks authentication or user-specific task views.
- Drag-and-drop could be smoother.

## Improvements

- Add context or Redux for better state handling
- Improve modal UX with animations
- Persist form data for better error handling
